# Contribution guidelines

We appreciate that you're interested in helping with moving the project forward. Before you submit your first PR, please read the following guide. We'd hate to see you work on something that someone else is already working on, something that we agreed not to do or something that doesn't match the project.

You can find these guidelines here: <https://pnp.github.io/cli-microsoft365/contribute/contributing-guide>
